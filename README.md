# Method_kruskala
 
During the development of projects, it was often necessary to copy and peek at parts of the code from past projects, so
I saved everything on the PC, and in git everything was in one repository (AllProjectForStyding), now
I sorted everything and created a separate repository

Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. If the graph is connected, it finds a minimum spanning tree. (A minimum spanning tree of a connected graph is a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree is minimized. For a disconnected graph, a minimum spanning forest is composed of a minimum spanning tree for each connected component.) It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as in each step it adds the next lowest-weight edge that will not form a cycle to the minimum spanning forest.
